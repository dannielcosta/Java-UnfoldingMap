# Unfolding Map Project

Welcome to the Unfolding Map project repository for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) COURSERA course from the University of California San Diego.

## Overview

This project is a Java-based application developed as part of the OOP course. It focuses on implementing interactive maps using the Unfolding Maps library and applying object-oriented principles learned throughout the course.

## Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Explore and interact with dynamic maps, zooming in/out and panning across various locations.
- **Data Visualization**: Display real-time data sets such as earthquakes, weather, or population statistics on the map.
- **Custom Markers**: Implement custom markers to represent different types of data points on the map.
- **User Interaction**: Enable users to click on markers to view additional information or perform actions.

## Requirements

To run the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE of your choice)
- Unfolding Maps library


## Usage

- Upon running the application, explore the interactive map by using mouse controls to zoom in/out and pan across locations.
- Click on markers to view additional information or perform actions associated with the data points.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
